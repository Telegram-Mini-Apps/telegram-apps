# `HapticFeedback`

Implements Telegram Mini
Apps [haptic feedback](../../../platform/haptic-feedback.md) functionality.

::: info

If this functionality does not work on your device: check the settings. For example, 
for the Android mobile system, you need to go to _"Settings" > "Sound & Vibration" > 
"Vibration & Haptics"_ and find the _"Touch feedback"_ option. It should **not** be 
zero.
