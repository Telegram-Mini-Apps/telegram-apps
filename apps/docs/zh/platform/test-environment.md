# Test Environment

Telegram provides the special environment for development with some specific features. For example,
a developer will be allowed to create a new Telegram bot and specify a Mini Apps link with HTTP
protocol or even IP. As opposed to the test environment, in production, a developer is only allowed
to specify links with HTTPS protocol. That's why this step is important during the Mini App
development process.

::: info

You are only allowed to create a new account in the test environment in mobile versions of Telegram.
Nevertheless, in this documentation, you will find out how to link to these accounts in other
versions of Telegram.
