# Swipe Behavior

Mini Apps are intended to handle different, and at times, complex scenarios where the user can
navigate deep into the application architecture. It's a common situation when a user is following a
specific workflow, such as purchasing an airplane ticket, which involves multiple steps.

Accidentally swiping down a Mini App can be a significant disappointment for the user. To
prevent this, developers have the option to configure the swipe behavior, so application won't hide in the dock.

To enable swipe confirmation, Telegram Mini Apps provides a method
called [web_app_setup_swipe_behavior](methods.md#web-app-setup-swipe-behavior).
