# Init Data

In the list of [launch parameters](launch-parameters), initialization data is located in
the `tgWebAppData` parameter. It is a set of data mostly related to a specific user who launched
the Mini App.

A striking feature of init data is the fact that it can be used as an authentication or
authorization factor. For this reason, do not forget about the security of the application
and init data specifically.

## Retrieving

To extract init data, a developer can use the `retrieveLaunchParams` function
from [@telegram-apps/sdk](../packages/telegram-apps-sdk/2-x).

```typescript
import { retrieveLaunchParams } from '@telegram-apps/sdk';

const { initDataRaw, initData } = retrieveLaunchParams();
```

## Authorization and Authentication

A special feature of initialization data is the ability to be used as a factor for authorization or
authentication. The fact is that the data generated by the native Telegram application is signed
with the secret key of the Telegram bot, after which the generated signature is placed next to the
parameters themselves.

Thus, knowing the secret key of the Telegram bot, the developer has the opportunity to verify the
signature of the parameters and make sure that they were indeed issued to the specified user.

Also, the signature verification operation is fast enough and does not require large server
resources.

::: tip

You can find examples using different programming languages in [this](authorizing-user.md) article.

:::

## Sending to Server

In order to authorize the user on the server, the developer needs to transmit the initialization
data that was specified when launching the Mini App. To make life easier for yourself, the
developer can transmit them at each request to the server, after which the signature verification is
carried out on the server side.

Here is how a developer could send init data to server:

```typescript
import { retrieveLaunchParams } from '@telegram-apps/sdk';

const { initDataRaw } = retrieveLaunchParams();

fetch('https://example.com/api', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `tma ${initDataRaw}`
  },
});
```

In turn, the following actions must be performed on the server side:

1. Get the value of the `Authorization` header;
2. Check that the first part of it is equal to `tma`;
3. Get init data and [validate](#validating) its signature.

If this algorithm is successful, the server part of the application can trust the transmitted
init data.

## Validating

Init data validation is one of the most important parts in communication
between client and server. It's validity guarantees, that init data can be trusted
and used in the future code execution.

Knowing, that init data is presented as query parameters list, to validate
them, developer should follow the steps:

1. Iterate over all key-value pairs and create an array of string values in
   format `{key}={value}`. Key `hash` should be excluded, but memoized. It
   represents the init data sign and will be used in the final step of the validation process.
2. Sort the computed array in the alphabetical order.
3. Create HMAC-SHA256 using key `WebAppData` and apply it to the Telegram Bot
   token, that is bound to your Mini App.
4. Create HMAC-SHA256 using the result of the previous step as a key. Apply
   it to the pairs array joined with linebreak (`\n`) received in the 2-nd step
   and present the result as hex symbols sequence.
5. Compare the `hash` value received in the 1-st step with the result of the 4-th step.
6. If these values are equal, passed init data can be trusted.

::: tip
In real-world applications, it is recommended to use additional mechanisms for verifying
initialization data. For example, add their expiration date. This check can be implemented using
the `auth_date` parameter, which is responsible for the date when the parameters were created. This
solution will allow in case of theft of initialization data to prevent their constant use by an
attacker.
:::

::: tip

To avoid possible problems related to the init data validation process, we recommend utilizing
well-established and
tested packages:

- For Node: [@telegram-apps/init-data-node](../packages/telegram-apps-init-data-node)
- For GoLang: [init-data-golang](../packages/init-data-golang.md)

:::

### Example

#### 1. Initial Input

- **Telegram Bot token**: This value is used to sign the init data, and we will need it in the later
  steps of the validation process.

```
5768337691:AAH5YkoiEuPk8-FZa32hStHTqXiLPtAEhx8
```

- **Init data**: This data should be passed directly from the mini application to the server as-is.

```
query_id=AAHdF6IQAAAAAN0XohDhrOrc&user=%7B%22id%22%3A279058397%2C%22first_name%22%3A%22Vladislav%22%2C%22last_name%22%3A%22Kibenko%22%2C%22username%22%3A%22vdkfrost%22%2C%22language_code%22%3A%22ru%22%2C%22is_premium%22%3Atrue%7D&auth_date=1662771648&hash=c501b71e775f74ce10e377dea85a7ea24ecd640b223ea86dfe453e0eaed2e2b2
```

#### 2. Create Key-Value Pairs and Extract Signature

As per the validation process, we should parse the init data as query parameters. Then, take all
key-value pairs excluding the `hash` key, join them with the `=` symbol, and sort them in
alphabetical order. The final array must be joined with the linebreak symbol (`\n`).

The result will be:

```
auth_date=1662771648\nquery_id=AAHdF6IQAAAAAN0XohDhrOrc\nuser={"id":279058397,"first_name":"Vladislav","last_name":"Kibenko","username":"vdkfrost","language_code":"ru","is_premium":true}
```

The signature is the value in the `hash` key. In this case, it equals:

```
c501b71e775f74ce10e377dea85a7ea24ecd640b223ea86dfe453e0eaed2e2b2
```

#### 3. Create Telegram Bot Token Signature

To verify if the init data is signed correctly, we need to sign it ourselves. First, we must create
an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the Telegram Bot token, using the `WebAppData` value as the
cryptographic key.

Here is the result:

```
HMAC-SHA256(
  5768337691:AAH5YkoiEuPk8-FZa32hStHTqXiLPtAEhx8,
  WebAppData
) = a5c609aa52f63cb5e6d8ceb6e4138726ea82bbc36bb786d64482d445ea38ee5f
```

> [!WARNING]  
> The received value must not be transformed into a hexadecimal sequence, as shown above. In the
> next step, use it as-is (an array of bytes), but you can use the hexadecimal value to check if your
> code generates the hash correctly.

#### 4. Create and Compare Init Data Signature

Finally, we compute the init data signature.

To do this, create another HMAC-SHA256 signature using the transformed init data from Step 2 as the
input, and the hash we received in Step 3 as the cryptographic key.

Here is the result:

```
HMAC-SHA256(
  auth_date=1662771648\nquery_id=AAHdF6IQAAAAAN0XohDhrOrc\nuser={"id":279058397,"first_name":"Vladislav","last_name":"Kibenko","username":"vdkfrost","language_code":"ru","is_premium":true},
  *signature from Step 3*,
) = c501b71e775f74ce10e377dea85a7ea24ecd640b223ea86dfe453e0eaed2e2b2
```

Now, by comparing the result with the `hash` value from Step 2, we can confirm that they are
identical. This means we can trust the passed init data.
