# Events

Events are signals, sent from Telegram native application in case, when some external action was
done. Like methods, each event has its unique name and parameters.

## Web

As mentioned before, the web version uses a standard way of communication between iframes. It means,
the parent iframe is able to send events through `window.postMessage` function. To handle this type
of message, it is enough to add `message` event listener on the global `window` object:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('message', ...);
```

The native application will send an event with `data: string` which represents a JSON object
converted to string. This object has the same interface as we defined in
the [Methods](methods.md#web) section:

```typescript
interface MessageJSON {
  eventType: string;
  eventData: any;
}
```

Then, lets imagine how we could process an event from Telegram application:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('message', ({ data }) => {
  const { eventType, eventData } = JSON.parse(data);
  console.log(eventType, eventData);
});
```

::: warning

In this code, we assumed, that the `message` event is sent only by the native application which is
not always true in real applications. Additionally, we didn't check if `data` is really of
type `string`. Don't forget to check each type and appropriately process incoming events.

:::

## Desktop, Mobile and Windows Phone

Desktop, mobile, and Windows Phone versions of Telegram don’t use the method, described in the
previous section. They do it in a bit unusual way. The first thing developer should know, is in
case, when Telegram needs to emit an event, it will insert JavaScript code, which calls a globally
defined function.

Here is an example:

```typescript
window.Telegram.WebView.receiveEvent('popup_closed', {
  button_id: 'cancel'
});
```

Path to this function depends on platform:

- `window.TelegramGameProxy.receiveEvent` - Telegram Desktop;
- `window.Telegram.WebView.receiveEvent` - Telegram for iOS and Android;
- `window.TelegramGameProxy_receiveEvent` - Windows Phone

All of these functions have the same signature:

```typescript
type ReceiveEvent = (eventType: string, eventData: unknown) => void;
```

So, the solution is rather simple. To handle incoming events we should create a function of this
type and assign it to all 3 paths.

## Listening to Events

Handling all possible environments for a developer's application can be challenging. To simplify
this process, the community developed the [@telegram-apps/sdk](../packages/telegram-apps-sdk/2-x)
package, which greatly eases integration.

Here's how to use it:

```ts
import { on } from '@telegram-apps/sdk';

// Start listening to "viewport_changed" event. Returned value
// is a function, which removes this event listener.
const removeListener = on('viewport_changed', payload => {
  console.log('Viewport changed:', payload);
});

// Remove this event listener.
removeListener();
```

You can learn more about calling methods in the
package's [documentation](../packages/telegram-apps-bridge/events.md#listening-to-events).
