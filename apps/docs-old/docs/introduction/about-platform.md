# About platform

Telegram Mini Apps is a technology created by developers of the famous messenger
Telegram.
The main it’s purpose is to provide developers more flexible communication
channel with Telegram users.

It may seem not clear, but Web Apps are not self-served services. The first
thing to note is, technically, this technology is just an add-on for such
already-known Telegram functionality as Telegram Bots. So, currently, creating a
Web App without creating a Telegram Bot is not available.

The platform offers a high variety of available methods to communicate with the
Telegram application to make your web applications look more native, allow them
to simulate native application's behavior, and, finally, **mimic** native
applications.
